Something somewhere between [this](http://xkcd.com/518/), IFTTT and Yahoo Pipes, right? I mean eventually, not right now. And more the former than the latter.


To be easy to create rules, easy to tie them together and take data from the local data youâ€™ve got, as well as potentially external sources. JSON in, JSON out.

### Install

To start your CEDAR application you have to:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Create a database (see below)
3. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

Later, you can `mix cedar.database delete`


### Creating a database

To create a database (for development) you should do the following:

```
createuser cedar -S

# Development
createdb cedar -O cedar -E utf8

# Tests
createdb cedar_test -O cedar -E utf8

mix ecto.migrate
```


### To manage the audit log

#### Purge

```mix audit purge```

#### Compress

```mix audit archive```

### Email settings

In order to actually send emails with MAILGUN, you'll need to set the
```MAILGUN_KEY``` environment variable to your API key.
